# 2018 - 2020 CitiBike Use Statistics 

This report is generated based on data provided in https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data for bike use statistics between 2018 and 2020.



## Citibike Use




![City Use Over The Years](Images/01_TripCountsPerYear.png)


+ In 2018, there are 353,892 trips recorded in CitiBike systems. 

+ In 2019 this number increased to 404,947. In 2019 there was a record number of 66.6 million of visitors to New York City, which helped the boost the number of bike use. 
  
+ In 2020, the citi bike use numbers decreased to 336,802. The main reason of this decrease is the Covid restrictions/lockdowns in May.



![Monthly Growth Over The Years](Images/02_GrowthOverYear.png) 


+ **In May 2020, you can see a significant jump in bike use. The murder of George Floyd leaded to a series of protests in the city, and the history of conflict between police and the cyclists increased the role of the bicycles.**
  

## Customer Type Distribution

![Customer Type Distribution Over The Years](Images/03_CustomerTypeDistribution.png) 

The short term customer percentage particularly increased in 2020, and annual subscriptions dropped from %33 to %21. The main reason of this drop is the lockdowns, changing working conditions of people, and habits.

## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar


## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code


Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

``` js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```
